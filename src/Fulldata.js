    title: "G 2-7 – The superior workshop compressor",
    about: `Efficient, productive, quiet and clean – these are just some of the benefits of our G 2-7 range of oil-injected rotary screw compressors. 
    The G 2-7 models are the smallest rotary screw compressors in our portfolio – but they pack a punch in every way. They are the ideal solution for small companies, workshops and operations with an infrequent compressed air demand that are looking to expand.`   ,
